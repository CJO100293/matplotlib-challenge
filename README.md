## Starter Code
The basis for the code used in the "# Get the duplicate mice by ID number that shows up for Mouse ID and Timepoint." step was found from https://github.com/redeat17/Matplotlib-Challenge/blob/master/pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb

The basis for the code used in the "# Create a clean DataFrame by dropping the duplicate mouse by its ID." step was found with the help of AskBCS as well as https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-isin-explained-with-examples/ and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14057007/remove-rows-not-isinx

the basis for the alternative code used in the "# Alternate method to accomplish the same as above:" which is commented out in the "# Create a clean DataFrame by dropping the duplicate mouse by its ID." step was done with the assistance of Steve Bennett.

## Summary Statistics
the basis for the code used in the "# Using the aggregation method, produce the same summary statistics in a single line" step was found from https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.22/generated/pandas.core.groupby.DataFrameGroupBy.agg.html

## Bar and Pie Charts
The basis for the code used in the "# Generate a bar plot showing the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen using Pandas." step was worked on with Tyler White in a study group and AskBCS

The basis for the code used in the "# Generate a bar plot showing the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen using pyplot." step was worked on with the help of AskBCS.

The basis for the code used in the "# Generate a pie plot showing the distribution of female versus male mice using pyplot" step was helped out with by AskBCS.

## Quartiles, Outliers and Boxplots
The basis for the code used in the "# Start by getting the last (greatest) timepoint for each mouse" step was worked out with the help of https://www.sweetstudy.com/questions/matplotlib-challenge

The basis for the code used with my "outliers" variable in the "# Determine outliers using upper and lower bounds" step was worked out with the help of https://www.nagwa.com/en/videos/985101043283/ and https://towardsdatascience.com/outlier-detection-part1-821d714524c

The basis for the code used in my "# Setting marker colors and size" section of the "# Generate a box plot that shows the distrubution of the tumor volume for each treatment group." step was found at https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/pyplots/boxplot_demo_pyplot.html#sphx-glr-gallery-pyplots-boxplot-demo-pyplot-py and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43342564/flier-colors-in-boxplot-with-matplotlib with the help of AskBCS
